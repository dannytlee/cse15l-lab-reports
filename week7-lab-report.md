# week 7 lab report

* The task that I chose to do is to change all of the start variable names to base. To start editing, I used the command vim DocSearchServer.java
* in vim, my first comman was /start <Enter>. This brought me to the first instance of the word start

* next I used dw to delete the word start

* then I used i to enter insert mode, then typed base to write base into the file as the new variable name.

* <Escape> got me back into normal mode. Then n brought me to the next instance of the word start. n in vim is used to repeat the last search

* again I deleted the word with dw

* then used i to enter insert mode and typed out base to replace the variable name.
