## less command option -N
* The -N option adds line numbers. This can be useful for editing a file. It is much easier to identify which part of the file to edit if you can just reference lines instead of looking through the whole file for a specific part. It is also very helpful when working with partners for the ability to identify which part of the file you are talking about.

## less command option -X

* After exiting out of less, the contents of the file disappear off the screen by default. Using the -X option makes the contents of the file stay on the screen after exiting less mode. This is useful because you are able to look at the contents of the file while using the terminal for other things. This also means that you are able to look at multiple different files in the same terminal.

## less command option -E
* The -E option causes the file to close after the user reaches the end of the file. This is useful because it can save you keystrokes. It would make looking at many different files much faster.
